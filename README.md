## Abstract

Currently prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including the Delta and Omicron variants (BA.1 and BA.2), and descendent lineages, pose a new challenge to transmission. The Omicron BA.2 variant has replaced the Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants worldwide. It is of significance to make a comparative investigation on Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2, as SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to mutate more rapidly. We selected three outbreaks caused by different variants in China and estimated epidemiological parameters and vaccine effectiveness. Omicron BA.2 was transmitted faster than BA.1 and Delta, with shorter serial interval (2.24 days vs. 3.00 days vs. 5.70 days) and larger effective reproductive number (3.56 vs. 2.94 vs. 1.93), despite full vaccine and booster dose coverage being increased. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of vaccines against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 infections in the regression model. Increasing booster vaccination rates and increasing treatment availability are necessary to avoid excess mortality in the event of a future pandemic.
